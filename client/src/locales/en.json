  "about.content-1": "Inspiration to create the {appName} application was born out of the need to manage our office equipment. In the initial phase, it was to be only an internal training project for new employees. By participating in the project, developers were free to choose technology and tools. The {appName} application can also be an interesting point in the portfolio of every employee who participated in the process of creating this product.",
  "about.content-2": " The main functionality of the application are the sacks on which we can place products that are currently missing in the company. Depending on the role of the user on the sack, he can add new products, vote for them, mark them as done and comment. As part of the application, you can also create cohorts that can help you organize and group your sacks. The visibility of sacks within a cohort depends on the sack of members of a given team. In the future, we plan to make the application an open-source project and anyone who wants to contribute to the project.",
